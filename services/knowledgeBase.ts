CORE PHILOSOPHY & PRINCIPLES:


Why would any red-blooded male want to avoid orgasm and ejaculation?  This blog covers two related but separate topics:  "Extreme Edging" and "Cum Denial."  A quick look at each:

Edging:

Edging is the business of working the cock to the threshold of ejaculation, then instead of dumping over the cliff and zipping up your pants, you suspend yourself at that "almost" point so you can continue in this state.  Quite simply, the point is to make the sensations last longer.  Given the choice between five minutes of pleasure or two hours of pleasure, it becomes a no-brain choice.  The actual and eventual ejaculation can wait while you ride the edge and have a good time.

Extended Cum Denial:

Why would anybody want to do this?  Most men I talk to seem to grasp the rationale for postponing ejaculation to extend the duration of pleasure.  But to deliberately end a session without ejaculation?  What the fuck?  This is the question I field most often.

When I first happened upon the concept of extended cum denial, I was skeptical at the least.  It struck me as something a monk would practice in a monastery, like a vow of poverty, a self-flagellating vow of chastity.  An austerity.  Something to do with purity.  The word "denial" held no appeal, unless one is embarked on some kind of sacrificial path.

Make no mistake, I am a totally obsessed, addicted cock freak.  This has nothing to do with austerity or purity, and everything to do with intensity.  This is not hands-off chastity, but fully hands-on active masturbation.  When you actively masturbate but deny the cock its expected release, the sexual tension grows, the intensity of sensation increases.  Between cock sessions, you are energized and sexually aware.  Rather than denying the cock, we intensify the cock.  That, boys, is worth the price of admission.

An online friend wrote, on the occasion of having passed 150 days without ejaculation, "It has been an INCREDIBLE experience no man should go without - at least once!"  Mind you, this was 150 days of active masturbation, not 150 days of drought.  Those of us who practice cum denial do it for a reason, and believe me the reason is lustful, horny, and intensely sexual.

Edging is the art of masturbating your cock to the edge of cumming, but not letting it spill over the brink.  You keep the sensations going and building over time, prolonging the pleasure.

Observers of my web cam sometimes ask how this is possible.  They say they simply can't last like that.  Learning to edge your cock begins with a basic reversal of mindset.  Most men accept the assumption that the goal of stroking is to cum.  The goal of edging is NOT to cum.

Your cock will tell you otherwise, and this is where most men fail.  A cock wants to cum and an edger refuses the demand.  You're gonna cum sooner or later, so it might as well be later so you can enjoy longer the work your cock was born to do.  After a few minutes, the immediate urge to cum will subside and you level out into something really pleasant.

Most edgers I have spoken to use a rise and fall technique.  They stroke and let the feeling build till they are almost ready to cum, then they back off and let things die down.  Once the urge to cum is under control, they begin the process again, repeatedly stopping or backing off to postpone cumming.  Again, the goal must be not to cum, or you'll get carried away.

Personally, I no longer use this rise and fall technique.  With practice two things develop over time:  you learn exactly how your cock reacts and you learn that the urge to cum can be ignored.  I prefer to build my cock to the edge of cumming and keep it there, instead of repeatedly backing down.

I suppose what I do could be considered a series of mini rise and fall cycles.  I build the feelings close to the edge, but instead of stopping and letting the pleasure die off, I just pause for a few seconds and stroke again.  Stroke, pause, stroke, pause, constantly pushing my cock into The Zone.

In addition to mental control, with practice you develop muscle control as well.  If you were pissing and wanted to cut off the flow before you were finished, you'd know what muscles to tighten.  The same muscle tightening will hold back your cum.  I read somewhere that you can exercise these muscles throughout the day, squeezing like you are cutting off a piss while driving or at work, but I seldom remember to do it.

Cum denial is power.

Over the past several months I have taken my edging to a new level. Everything I have written to this point has been about edging in terms of individual sessions. Stroking for hours before unloading.

In recent months I have begun practicing extended cum denial, and the benefits are exotic. Instead of cumming at the end of an edging session, I deny the cum, accumulating days and days without release.

This practice creates an ever-increasing sexual energy that is difficult to describe if you've never experienced it personally. It takes a few days to get there. One edge buddy described it as having the brake and the gas pedal both mashed to the floorboard. What an exotic contradiction is edging.

Because I'm not cumming at the end of a long edge session, my cock is never entirely out of my thoughts for one moment. After a few days, you find yourself living in a sexually energized state. Males of every age around you seem to radiate sexuality. I love simply going to Wal-mart, where every man in every aisle seems sexualized. Life becomes sexual, even when you are not actively masturbating.

The practices of Kama Sutra and tantric yoga both describe this phenomenon, deliberately denying ejaculation after deliberately urging the cock to want to cum. This concept has been around for a long time. It is the principle I have described earlier, where the goal is NOT to cum, just carried to its next logical level.

It is a man's nature to cum. Extended cum retention defies this physiology and the results are extraordinary. It is a feeling of power - both power over one's own cock, and the powerful energy that builds in your balls and groin.

I feel like this description is rather inadequate to convey what this experience is like. I had intended to write in more detail, but I don't know what else to say. If you have tried edging for single sessions, you will probably understand the concept here. To work with this, you must understand that the goal is not to cum, and that the cock's urgency to cum anyway can be overruled.

First, I need to stipulate that the term "orgasm" in this treatise means a complete ejaculatory orgasm--the kind that exhausts a male's desire and plunges him into a refractory period. It does not mean the highly pleasurable non-ejaculatory state that is the object of edging, which event is sometimes called a non-ejaculatory orgasm, a mini-orgasm, a tantric orgasm, an extended orgasm, etc. Those are very worthy events, and please feel free to have them all day long with my blessing. However, unless a complete ejaculation is somehow involved in the process, they're not what I mean here by "orgasm." Also, everything below is equally applicable to penetrative sex with partners, but this being a masturbation forum, I will explain it all in masturbatory terms.

Okay, with that out of the way, here's the meat of my topic:

All masturbators can be divided into five classes according to the five different styles or philosophies of orgasm management that they employ. Even though there is an undeniable progression that can be followed through these five classes, I will hesitate to call them "rankings" or "levels" out of respect for those males who are content with the satisfaction that they obtain from their current station in the progression and choose to remain there.

The five styles of orgasm management can be called: default, voluntary, optional, exclusionary, and transcendent. They are further described as follows:

(1) Default
Every pubescent male who discovers masturbation begins here, hence it is the natural default. (This is not so much a style of orgasm management as it is the lack of any management.) Orgasm is his goal, and he typically rushes through the other sensations of masturbation with little thought. They are merely means toward an automatic orgasm at the end. His masturbatory pleasures tend to be of short duration, and the only way he knows to increase them is to masturbate more frequently. Unfortunately, there is a point of diminishing returns, where orgasms can become weakened and cheapened, such that the only thing less fulfilling than too-frequent orgasms is even more orgasms.

(2) Voluntary
Sooner or later, many males will gain voluntary control over the timing of their orgasms. This is the beginning of real orgasm management. The practitioner has learned that he can control the length of his sessions and have his orgasm only when he is ready. As he does, he begins to savor and take increased pleasure from all of the sensations of masturbation. A male using the most advanced form of voluntary orgasm management, known as "edging," extends the duration and multiplies the pleasure of his sessions by achieving the plateau phase of near-orgasmic bliss and remaining there as long as possible before he has his orgasm. He might also make repeated run-ups toward orgasm before he finishes himself off with an orgasm that easily eclipses the quality of the default variety. A male using this style is no longer dependent on frequency of orgasm for increased sexual pleasure. Still, though, he is wedded to orgasm as an essential part of each masturbatory session and cannot conceive of why anyone might want to opt out of having them.

(3) Optional
This is when a male has come to the realization that orgasm can be an optional part of masturbation and adopts a management style that omits it from some of his sessions. Edgers sometimes discover the value in this when some unexpected interruption forces them to abandon a session before its orgasmic conclusion. Other males are motivated to experiment when they read about orgasm denial or about Eastern practices such as tantra or Taoism. Once he experiences it, the male realizes that ending an edging session without orgasm produces exquisite feelings of frustration and horniness that vastly heighten his sense of masculinity and eroticism. It leaves him basking in an afterglow similar to the one that follows orgasm, except that it can last for hours. Opting out also builds character, because it takes a strong man to turn his back and walk away from an orgasm that's about to happen. In doing so, the modern Western male learns what many in the East have been taught in their youth since ancient times. Many males, once liberated from the Western ejaculatory imperative, will choose to decline available orgasms occasionally for the sake of variety and for the distinct pleasures available only via that means. Some others will alternate between their normal orgasmic responses and occasionally attempting binges of non-orgasmic edging for certain numbers of days, which can be incredibly pleasurable. Just as the voluntary style breaks a man's dependence on the diminishing returns of orgasmic frequency, the optional style further decouples the mental concepts of orgasm and sexual pleasure. As edgers become more accustomed to the alternate pleasure of opting out of orgasm, some begin to choose it more often than not and soon find themselves thinking of the next logical step in orgasm management.

(4) Exclusionary
This style of orgasm management begins when a male makes a conscious decision to exclude orgasm from his edging routine and to attempt to remain completely uncummed for either a long duration or indefinitely. This can occur only after sufficient experience with intermittent opting out has convinced the male that a whole new dimension of pleasures will more than adequately compensate for his sacrifice of orgasm. It's a momentous decision that requires character and commitment. (Interestingly, this is the precise solo equivalent of the goal of tantric intercourse.) The reliable extinguishing of orgasm is hard to achieve, and uninvited orgasms will crash the newbie's sessions, but each accident can be a learning opportunity on how to avoid the next. Some become discouraged and revert to the optional style of management, perhaps to try again later, but the devoted practitioner persists. He still desperately craves the orgasms that he denies himself, but it's that very desire that stokes his spiraling passion for ongoing denial. He takes increased pleasure from the increased frustration of his increased desire for the release that seldom or never comes. He simply derives more pleasure from edging with denial than he ever found in orgasm. He edges without orgasm at every opportunity, and his aggregate pleasure far exceeds anything he ever experienced or even imagined.

(5) Transcendent
The male reproductive system is amazingly capable of readapting its desires to whatever the sort of pleasure it receives over the longer term. Thus, the male who has succeeded in excluding orgasm from his edging routine can come to the rather sudden realization that his mind and genitals have rewired themselves to his current situation. He has transcended any need for orgasm management, because he no longer craves the orgasms that he no longer has. His passions and pleasures are as strong as ever, but they're no longer about orgasm. His formerly difficult task of denying orgasms has been replaced with a new normal of relaxed profound enjoyment of lengthy edging and arousal just for their own sakes. Orgasms are so far beyond his repertoire of sexual activities that neither they nor their absence even cross his mind during his sessions. When he must eventually stop, zip it up, and go about his day, he feels no frustration--only an intense sense of sexual satisfaction, those same heightened senses of masculinity and eroticism, and that long, intense afterglow. He has absolutely everything that he desires sexually. Orgasm? What's an orgasm? Even his memories of them are relegated to the mists of the past.
